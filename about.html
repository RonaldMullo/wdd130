            <section class="history">
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>White water rafting has a long history that dates back to the 19th century. It began as a means of transportation 
                    and exploration, especially in the United States. One of the earliest recorded rafting expeditions was led by John Wesley
                     Powell in 1869, when he and his team navigated the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. Over time, rafting evolved from
                     a survival necessity into a popular recreational activity. By the mid-20th century, advances in raft design and safety equipment 
                     made the sport more accessible to adventure 
                    seekers. Today, white water rafting is enjoyed worldwide, attracting thrill-seekers and nature lovers alike.</p>
