            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The history of whitewater rafting dates back to the early 19th century, with the first recorded 
                attempt to navigate the Snake River in 1811. However, the popularization of rafting as a sport 
                and recreational activity occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, with the emergence of rafting companies 
                and its inclusion in the 1972 Olympic Games. Prior to this, explorers and fishermen were already 
                navigating rivers in rafts of their own making, laying the groundwork for the later development of 
                modern rafting.
